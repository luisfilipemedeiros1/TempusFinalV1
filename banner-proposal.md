# New Banner Proposal for TempusFHFinal

## Requirements
- Create a simple, clean banner section that displays promotional images
- The banner should use the image's natural dimensions as reference
- Maintain a 2% padding around the entire banner
- Should work seamlessly on desktop and mobile
- No complex animations or sliders - just display the promotional content

## Current Image Assets
- Banner 1: https://i.ibb.co/3m3TYGvV/01.webp (Desktop) / https://i.ibb.co/27sR6SsT/01.webp (Mobile)
- Banner 2: https://i.ibb.co/3Y5mDJ4x/02.webp (Desktop) / https://i.ibb.co/1VYmnnW/02.webp (Mobile)  
- Banner 3: https://i.ibb.co/xqC48G06/03.webp (Desktop) / https://i.ibb.co/xtx47bxY/03.webp (Mobile)

## Design Approach Options
1. **Static Single Banner**: Display one promotional banner at a time
2. **Grid Layout**: Show all three banners in a responsive grid
3. **Stacked Layout**: Stack banners vertically with spacing
4. **Carousel (Simple)**: Basic carousel without complex animations

## Technical Considerations
- Use responsive images with picture element for mobile/desktop versions
- Ensure images are lazy loaded for performance
- Make banners clickable to scroll to contact form
- Accessibility: proper alt text and ARIA labels

## Question for Implementation
What would be the best approach to create a simple, effective banner section that:
1. Shows promotional content clearly
2. Uses image natural dimensions with 2% padding
3. Works well on all devices
4. Is easy to maintain and update
