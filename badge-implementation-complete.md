# Badge Implementation Complete ✅

## What Was Done:

### 1. Created Separate Badge CSS File
- **File**: `/css/badges.css`
- **Features**:
  - Clean, maintainable badge styles
  - High specificity selectors to avoid conflicts
  - Hover animations
  - Mobile responsive design
  - Print styles

### 2. Updated Functions.php
- Added `badges.css` to be loaded globally
- Incremented version to 2.0.4 for cache busting
- Badge styles load after main styles but before page-specific styles

### 3. Cleaned Up home.css
- Removed duplicate badge styles
- Removed temporary "urgent fix" CSS
- Cleaner, more maintainable code

### 4. Updated All Treatment Cards
- **Home page**: 9 cards with badges
  - HIFU, RF Microneedling (Best Seller), Lips, Exosomes (Trending), Body Contouring, Aquagold, Skin Boosters, Anti-Wrinkle, IV Infusions
- **Treatments Overview page**: 14 cards with price badges
  - All treatment cards now use consistent badge structure

### 5. Badge System Structure
```html
<div class="treatment-card scale-in">
    <div class="treatment-badges">
        <span class="badge badge-bestseller">Best Seller</span>
        <span class="badge badge-price">Starting at £XXX</span>
    </div>
    <!-- rest of card -->
</div>
```

## Badge Types:
- `.badge.badge-price` - Primary gold (#AF8F5A) with white text
- `.badge.badge-bestseller` - Accent gold (#C7A331) with dark text
- `.badge.badge-trending` - Deep teal (#004D40) with white text

## Key Features:
1. **Automatic stacking** - Multiple badges stack vertically with 8px gap
2. **Hover effects** - Subtle lift and shadow increase on hover
3. **Mobile responsive** - Smaller size and adjusted positioning
4. **High z-index** - Ensures badges appear above images
5. **Fade-in animation** - Smooth appearance with staggered timing

## Files Modified:
1. `/css/badges.css` - Created new
2. `/functions.php` - Added badge CSS enqueue
3. `/css/home.css` - Removed duplicate styles
4. `/home.php` - Updated all 9 treatment cards
5. `/page-treatments-overview.php` - Updated 14 treatment cards
