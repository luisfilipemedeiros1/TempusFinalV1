GEMINI CLI - RIBBON OVERLAP ISSUE

Context: Implementing price ribbons on treatment cards for Tempus Lounge luxury medical clinic. We have an overlap problem.

CURRENT SITUATION:
- Treatment cards can have "Best Seller" or "Trending" badges (top-left corner)
- I added price ribbons (top-right corner)
- Some cards have BOTH badges AND price ribbons, causing visual conflict

EXISTING STYLES:
1. Best Seller/Trending badges:
   - Position: top: 20px, left: 20px
   - Style: Small rectangular badges with rounded corners
   - Colors: Gold for "Best Seller", Deep Teal for "Trending"

2. Price ribbons (newly added):
   - Position: top: 20px, right: 20px  
   - Style: Rounded pill shape
   - Color: Gold background, white text

PROBLEM: When a card has both a badge AND a price, they're at the same height (top: 20px) which looks crowded.

SOLUTIONS TO CONSIDER:
A) Stack vertically - Move price ribbon down when badge exists (top: 60px)
B) Combine into one element - "Best Seller | Starting at ¬£750"
C) Different corners - Keep as is (left vs right corners)
D) Price at bottom of card instead of ribbon
E) Make price part of the content area (not a ribbon)

Which approach best maintains luxury aesthetic while solving the overlap?

Also consider:
- Mobile responsiveness (cards get narrower)
- Visual hierarchy (what should user see first?)
- Brand consistency with existing design
