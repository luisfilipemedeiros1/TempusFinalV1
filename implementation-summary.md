# Implementation Summary - Gemini Recommendations

## Gemini CLI Feedback Received ✅

### Decisions Made:
1. **Deploy to staging immediately** (1A) - For quick testing given time sensitivity
2. **Add inline pricing to conditions pages** (2A) - "HIFU (from £350) →" format
3. **Use card format for package pricing** (3B) - Clean, elegant presentation
4. **Keep "Starting at £350" format** (4A) - Best for luxury positioning

## Immediate Actions:

### 1. Deploy to Staging (NOW)
- Current implementation is ready for staging
- Test on real devices immediately after deployment
- Proceed with code review post-staging

### 2. Conditions Pages Update (Priority)
Implement inline pricing format:
```php
// Update getRecommendedTreatments() function
'HIFU' => [
    'link' => '/treatment/hifu-high-intensity-focused-ultrasound/',
    'price' => 'from £350'
]

// Display as: "HIFU (from £350) →"
```

### 3. Package Pricing Cards (Next)
Create elegant card format:
```html
<div class="package-cards">
    <div class="price-card">
        <h4>Single Session</h4>
        <div class="price">£750</div>
    </div>
    <div class="price-card featured">
        <h4>4 Sessions Package</h4>
        <div class="price">£2,700</div>
        <div class="savings">Save 10%</div>
    </div>
</div>
```

### 4. Add Disclaimer (Quick Fix)
Add to footer or treatment sections:
"Prices are indicative and subject to consultation"

## Gemini's Key Insights:

1. **Transparency matters** for affluent clientele - they prefer upfront pricing
2. **Card format** aligns with luxury brand aesthetics
3. **"Starting at"** subtly suggests bespoke options without being vague
4. **Time is critical** - deploy first, refine later

4. ⏳ Add pricing disclaimer
5. ⏳ Test on multiple devices
